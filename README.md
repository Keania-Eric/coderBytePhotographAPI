## Problem Statement

A company is considering starting a app for product photography to connect pro-photographers to people who need good photography for their products. Product owners will be able send the product they want to phograph to a processing facility where photographers will come to and take high resolution pictures of these physical products.



The process will begin from the product owner's end to request from an admin interface made for them and the photographers can see these requests and track the product they need to go shoot from their own admin interface.

Once pictures have been taken, the product owner will be notified and sent low-quality thumbnails of the picture that were taken. The product owner can approve or disapprove the thumbnail. If they approve, the High resolution image is made available for them immediately and they can use it for whatever they want or even download it.

## Task

Your task is to develop a API (using Laravel) that will handle the end-to-end processes involved to make this app possible. You don't need to make the UI, only the API is needed. Your development will take care of product assignment to pro-photographers, storage, picture quality delivery, etc.
